This is about creating a Hangman game
Project tells you how to play the game of hangman

                print("You already tried that letter!")
            else:
                self.check_guess(guess)  # Call the check_guess method
                self.list_of_guesses.append(guess)  # Append the guess to the list_of_guesses

# Usage example:
# hangman_game = Hangman(["apple", "banana", "cherry"])
# hangman_game.ask_for_input()  # Call this method to start the game
